This repository contains class material along with any useful information for the 2025-26 academic year.

### Class Schedule
- **Tuesday** from **4:00 PM** to **7:00 PM** 
- **Thursday** from **3:00 PM** to **5:00 PM**

Both classes will take place in **Room 3 at Via De Lollis** (RM158). Please use the entrance located at Via Tiburtina, 205 ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/TgnJCWDfx2VQRo4u5))

### Moodle Web Page
Students must subscribe to the Moodle web page using the same credentials (username/password) to access the Wi-Fi network and Infostud services at the following link: https://elearning.uniroma1.it/course/view.php?id=20053

### Office Hours
Please drop me a message to <a href="mailto:tolomei@di.uniroma1.it">tolomei@di.uniroma1.it</a> if you would like to arrange an in-person meeting or schedule a remote call on either Google Meet or Zoom. To issue your request, kindly specify "_SN-I 2025-26: Meeting_" in the subject of your message.<br/>
In-person meetings will be held in my office, which is located in Room 106 on the 1st floor of Building E in Viale Regina Elena 295 ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/5dSuQbvaeqXePV9y6)).

### Description and Goals
The _Operating System_ (OS) is the key component of any modern computing device. Moreover, it very well represents a fundamental concept at the heart of any Computer Science curriculum, namely _abstraction_.

More specifically, by virtualizing the physical resources of a computer system, the OS allows programmers to develop software applications without worrying about the nitty-gritty of the hardware. Decoupling the software from the hardware guarantees more flexibility for the system developer as well as greater usability for the end user.
It is therefore essential for any Computer Science student to have the ability to comprehend how to effectively and efficiently design and exploit the main functionalities of a highly complex software system, such as a modern operating system.

To this end, we will deeply discuss the key responsibilities of so-called general-purpose OSs (i.e., those typically installed on our PCs and laptops). Amongst those responsibilities are: CPU scheduling, process/thread synchronization, memory management, and file systems, just to name a few. In addition, we will explore how OSs should adapt to resource-limited mobile devices (i.e., tablets and smartphones).

All the concepts introduced are totally covered by the lecture materials provided during the course and will be treated independently of a specific operating system implementation. However, many examples will be taken from popular OSs available on the market, like UNIX/Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, etc.

### Prerequisites
- Fundamentals of computer architectures
- Basics of computer programming

### Exams
To pass the exam, a **mandatory written test** is required, consisting of a **Moodle multiple-choice quiz** lasting **45 minutes**, which will take place in the laboratory.  
The outcome of the written test determines the following conditions:

| Written Score | Outcome | Oral Exam |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| **[15, 17]**  | Admitted to oral exam | **Mandatory** |
| **≥ 18**      | Sufficient | **Optional** (the student can confirm the grade or take an additional oral exam) |
| **< 15**      | Not passed | -- |

**Note:**  
*(a)* With a score in the range **[15, 17]**, the oral exam is **required** to pass the exam.  
*(b)* With a score **≥18**, the oral exam is an **optional choice for the student**.  
*(c)* With a score **<15**, the exam is **not passed**, and the written test must be retaken in a subsequent session.

In cases *(a)* and *(b)*, it is always possible to **decline** the grade obtained in the written test. Even in this case, the written test must be retaken in a subsequent session.

### Recommended Textbooks
Although they are **not** mandatory to pass the exam successfully, the following textbooks are really useful to anyone who wants to dig deeper into the subjects addressed in this course:
- _Operating System Concepts_ [Silberschatz _et al._];
- _Modern Operating Systems_ [Tanenbaum _et al._];
- _Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces_ [Remzi] (<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/" target="_blank">freely available online</a>).
