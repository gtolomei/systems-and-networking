## News

<!--- **Written Exam Session I (01/19/2023)**<br/> 
Registrations to the first written exam session are now open via Google Form at the following <a href="https://forms.gle/xCaHezp5SbaMfmjH8" target="_blank">link</a>. You must log in to your institutional Google account to access the form. Please, notice that this poll closes on **Sunday, January 15, 2023, at 11:59 p.m. CET**; only students who manifest their willingness to participate by that time will be allowed to attend the exam. If you change your mind and don't want to participate in this exam session anymore, please update your answer on the form accordingly, as this will significantly help me with the organization of the test.<br/>
As a reminder, this exam session is scheduled for **Thursday, January 19, 2023, from 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. CET** in **Aula Informatica 16**, located in Via Tiburtina, 205 ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/TgnJCWDfx2VQRo4u5)). However, notice that the time schedule above is **_tentative_**, and slight changes might occur if needed. For example, if the number of participants exceeds the room's capacity, there will be two consecutive rounds. Further details on how to attend this test will be therefore communicated close to the exam's date.<br/>
**NOTE:** _Students who are sure they will not attend this exam session **should not** fill out this form! Besides, everyone can decide to opt in by the closing date of this poll._

## General Information

Welcome to the System and Networking - Unit I class!

This is a second-year, first-semester course of the [BSc in Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence of Sapienza University of Rome](https://acsai.di.uniroma1.it/).

This repository contains class material along with any useful information for the 2023-24 academic year.

### Class Schedule
- **Wednesday** from **2:00 p.m.** to **5:00 p.m.** (Room 1L - Via del Castro Laurenziano, 7 [[map](https://goo.gl/maps/1x9rrSjsiieq41At6)])
- **Thursday** from **8:00 a.m.** to **10:00 a.m.** (Room 2L - Via del Castro Laurenziano, 7 [[map](https://goo.gl/maps/1x9rrSjsiieq41At6)])

### Moodle Web Page
Students must subscribe to the Moodle web page using the same credentials (username/password) to access Wi-Fi network and Infostud services, at the following link: https://elearning.uniroma1.it/course/view.php?id=16988

### Office Hours
Please, drop me a message to <a href="mailto:tolomei@di.uniroma1.it">tolomei@di.uniroma1.it</a> if you like to arrange an in-person meeting or schedule a remote call either on Google Meet or Zoom. To issue your request, kindly specify "_SN-I 2023-24: Meeting_" in the subject of your message.<br/>
In-person meetings will be held in my office, which is located in Room 106 on the 1st floor of Building E in Viale Regina Elena 295 ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/5dSuQbvaeqXePV9y6)).

### Description and Goals
The _Operating System_ (OS) is the key component of any modern computing device. Moreover, it very well represents a fundamental concept at the heart of any Computer Science curriculum, namely _abstraction_.

More specifically, by virtualizing the physical resources of a computer system, OS allows programmers to develop software applications without worrying about the nitty-gritty of the hardware. Decoupling the software from the hardware guarantees more flexibility for the system developer as well as greater usability for the end user.
It is therefore essential for any Computer Science student to have the ability to comprehend how to effectively and efficiently design and exploit the main functionalities of a highly complex software system, such as a modern operating system.

To this end, we will deeply discuss the key responsibilities of so-called general-purpose OSs (i.e., those typically installed on our PCs and laptops). Amongst those responsibilities are: CPU scheduling, process/thread synchronization, memory management, and file systems, just to name a few. In addition, we will explore how OSs should adapt to resource-limited mobile devices (i.e., tablets and smartphones).

All the concepts introduced are totally covered by the lecture materials provided during the course and will be treated independently from a specific operating system implementation. However, many examples will be taken from popular OSs available on the market like UNIX/Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, etc.

### Prerequisites
- Fundamentals of computer architectures
- Basics of computer programming

### Exams
Written and oral exam.
The written exam consists of a Moodle quiz containing **20 multiple-answer questions**. Each correct answer accounts for 3 points, each wrong answer subtracts 1 point, whilst no answer gives no points. The quiz is successfully passed if the overall score is **greater than or equal to 15/30**. Those who obtain a score ranging between 15/30 and 17/30 must take a mandatory oral exam; instead, those who passed the quiz with a score of 18/30 or higher can decide to accept this as their final score or to take an additional oral exam.

### Recommended Textbooks
Despite they are **not** mandatory to pass the exam successfully, the following textbooks are really useful to anyone who wants to dig deeper into the subjects addressed in this course:
- _Operating System Concepts_ [Silberschatz _et al._];
- _Modern Operating Systems_ [Tanenbaum _et al._];
- _Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces_ [Remzi] (<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/" target="_blank">freely available online</a>).
